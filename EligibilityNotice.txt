If the table above says that you’re eligible for a tax credit or cost sharing reductions, it means that we didn’t 
find you eligible for Medicaid. This could be based on several things, like your income, household size, 
residency, or immigration status among other things. More information on how to appeal an eligibility 
decision is described in the section of the notice, “What should I do if I think my eligibility results are wrong?”.

What should I do next?

 · If the table above says you’re eligible for a Special Enrollment Period, August 31, 2015 is the last day to 

choose a Marketplace plan. To make a selection, visit 

HealthCare.gov to compare health plans side by

side, or call the Marketplace Call Center at 1-800-318-2596 (TTY: 1-855-889-4325). 

 

 · If you miss the deadline, you may not be able to enroll in a health insurance plan through the 

Marketplace until the next open enrollment period, unless you qualify for another special enrollment 

period. 

 

 · Also, you and anyone in your household who doesn’t have qualifying health coverage for three months 

or longer out of the year could owe a penalty. 

When will coverage begin?

If you are eligible to purchase health coverage through the Marketplace and you choose a plan by the 15th of 
the month, your coverage in that plan will start on the first day of the following month. If you choose a plan 
after the 15th, your coverage will start on the first of the next following month. For example, if you choose a 
plan on March 16, your coverage in that plan will not start until May 1. 


 · You have to pay the first month’s premium before your coverage starts. 

 

 · If you are adding a child to your plan through birth, adoption, or foster placement, the child’s coverage 

will begin on their date of birth, adoption, placement for adoption, or placement in foster care, but no 

earlier than January 1, 2015. 

 

 · If you told us you recently got married or lost other health coverage, your coverage will begin the first 

day of the month following your plan selection. 

 

 · If you told us you are about to lose other health coverage, your Marketplace health coverage will begin 

the first day of the month following the day you lose other health coverage. 

What if information from my application changes during the year?

Changes to the information you provided on your application can affect your eligibility for coverage through 
the Marketplace. Changes may affect your eligibility for: 


 · premium tax credits 

 · enrollment in a plan with lower copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles 

 · coverage through Medicaid or Pennsylvania CHIP. 

 

If you’re eligible for a tax credit and you don’t report a change that may affect your eligibility, you may have to 
pay back some or all of your premium tax credits when you file your taxes. If information from your 
application changes during the year, you should report the change within 30 days. Contact the Marketplace at 
the phone number below to report these changes. 

If you have questions: Go to 

HealthCare.gov/marketplace. Or, call 1-800-318-2596. TTY users should call 1-855-889-4325. The call 
is free. You can also find out how to talk to someone in person, online or through the help line.

If you enroll in Marketplace coverage and later become eligible for minimum essential coverage, like 
Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare, you won’t be eligible for premium tax credits. You must contact the 
Marketplace to end your Marketplace coverage with premium tax credits. If you don’t, the person who files 
taxes in your household may need to pay back the premium tax credit when they file their federal tax return. 


If you're eligible for Medicaid or Pennsylvania CHIP, contact the state agency at the phone number listed in 
the section, “Where can I find more information,” to report changes.

What should I do if I think my eligibility results are wrong?

If you have received a final determination and you think we made a mistake, in many cases, you can appeal 
our decision about your eligibility for health coverage, including Medicaid, CHIP, purchasing health coverage 
through the Marketplace, a tax credit, cost-sharing reductions, and enrollment periods. 


Below is important information to consider when requesting an appeal: 


 · You have 90 days to request an appeal with the Marketplace from the date of this notice. 

 · You can have someone request or participate in your appeal if you want to. That person can be a 

friend, relative, lawyer, or other individual. Or, you can request and participate in your appeal on your 

own. 

 · If you request an appeal, you may be able to keep your eligibility for coverage while your appeal is 

pending. 

 · The outcome of an appeal could change the eligibility of other members of your household even if they 

don’t ask for an appeal. 

 · If we did not find you eligible for Medicaid and you appeal our decision, you will have a choice about 

whether the Marketplace or your state’s Medicaid agency hears your Medicaid appeal. More 

information about your options is included on the appeals request form. If you write your own letter 

to appeal a denial of Medicaid eligibility, please specify whether you would like to have your Medicaid 

appeal heard by the Medicaid agency or the Marketplace.

More information about Tax Credits 


What is a tax credit? 
A tax credit lowers the monthly cost (called a “premium”) you pay for health insurance. In some cases, you 
may pay no premium if your tax credit covers the entire premium amount. Tax credits help people with 
incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), but who still may 
not be able to afford health coverage. 


How do I qualify for a tax credit? 
The Marketplace will check your information, such as your income and household size, to see if you qualify for 
a tax credit. The tax credit is only available if you enroll in coverage through the Marketplace. If you're eligible 
for Medicare or most other types of health insurance coverage, then you probably don't qualify for a tax 
credit. If you're eligible for coverage from a job, you can only qualify for a tax credit if your employer doesn't 
offer affordable health coverage or the coverage doesn't meet a minimum value standard. In addition, your 
income must be above the limit for Medicaid in your state, but within the limits for a tax credit, which are 
outlined in the chart below. 


Income Limits for Tax Credits

$45,960 ($57,400 for Alaska)

5

$110,280 ($137,880 for Alaska)

6

$126,360 ($158,000 for Alaska)



How much of a tax credit can I get? 
Your tax credit amount is based on: 

 · The number of people in your household. Your household includes the person who pays taxes and 

his or her spouse and dependents, 

 · The income amount that you expect to put on your on your federal income tax return for 2015, 

and 

 · The cost of a “silver level” health plan in your area. A silver level health plan is a plan that provides 

the set of essential health benefits required by the Marketplace and also covers 70% of health care 

costs for the average person. You can see the health plans available using our plan finder on 

HealthCare.gov. 

 

 

Do I have to wait until I file my federal tax return to get the tax credit? 
You do not have to wait until you file your federal income tax return to get your tax credit. You can have 
some or all of your tax credit paid directly by the Federal government to your health plan to reduce the

premium for the health plan that you select through the Marketplace. You will make this choice when you 
choose a plan. 


You can decide to enroll in a plan without a tax credit or with less than the full amount, and get the full 
amount, based on your actual income at the end of the year, when you file your taxes. Even if you don't 
owe any taxes, you may still be eligible for a tax credit. You need to enroll in a plan through the 
Marketplace in order for the IRS to see if you qualify for a tax credit when you file your taxes. If you don't 
enroll in a plan through the Marketplace, you won't be eligible for a tax credit when you file your federal 
tax return with IRS (and you may owe a penalty if you don't have qualifying coverage for three months or 
longer). 


I’m not sure what my income for the year will be, so I just guessed on my application. What happens if I’m 
wrong? 
When it's time to file your federal income tax return, the IRS will compare the income from your 
application with the income you report on your tax return. 

 · If your income is lower than what you told us on your application, you may receive a tax refund. 

 · If your income is higher than what you told us on your application, you may have to pay back some 

of your tax credit. 

If you're worried about owing back any tax credit, you can take a smaller amount of the tax credit to use each 
month. You can decide how much of the tax credit you want to take when you enroll in a plan through the 
Marketplace. 


What kind of changes do I need to report? 
If information from your application changes, you should report the change to us within 30 days of the change 
occurring. If you don't report changes, you may have to pay back some or all of your tax credit when you file 
your taxes. Examples of changes you should report include: 

 · A move 

 · Household income changes 

 · Household size changes. For example, someone in your household marries or divorces, becomes 

pregnant, or has a child 

 · Becoming qualified for other health coverage 

 · Changes in immigration status 

 · Becoming incarcerated, other than pending the disposition of charges 

 · A change in plan for filing your federal income tax return for 2015; for example, you plan to claim new 

dependents on your tax return 

 

To report changes, log into your Marketplace account on 

HealthCare.gov/marketplace, or call 1-800-318-2596 
(TTY: 1-855-889-4325).

Will my employer know that I am getting a tax credit? 
We're required to notify your employer if you're getting a tax credit or cost-sharing reductions because 
your employer may need to make a shared responsibility payment. Your employer is not allowed to treat 
you differently based on your eligibility for a tax credit or cost-sharing reductions. The law prohibits your 
employer from firing or discriminating against you because you or someone in your household has been 
determined eligible for a tax credit or cost-sharing reductions. If you believe that you were fired or 
otherwise discriminated against because you or someone in your household was determined eligible for a 
tax credit or cost-sharing reductions, you can file a complaint with the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health 
Administration (OSHA). Visit 

www.whistleblowers.gov for more information. 


Do I need to apply for a new tax credit every year? 
You must renew your tax credit every year. Watch for a letter from us in August or September with 
information about next year. 


More information about Lower Out-of-Pocket Costs 


What are copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles? 
Copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles are the money you pay toward your share of the cost of your 
health care. They are also called “cost sharing.” Your insurance company pays the rest. 

 · A copayment is an amount you may be required to pay each time you receive a service, like going 

to the doctor or getting a prescription. It is usually a set dollar amount, like $20. 

 · Coinsurance is your share of the costs of a covered health service calculated as a percent of the 

allowed amount for the service. You pay coinsurance plus any deductibles you owe. 

 · A deductible is the amount of money you must spend every year on health care before the plan 

starts paying. Even after you pay your deductible, you may still be required to pay copayments or 

coinsurance when you receive services. 

 

 
How do I qualify for lower copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles? 
Your income must be within certain limits in order to also qualify for a Marketplace plan with discounted 
copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. Once you qualify, most people must enroll in a “silver level plan” 
to get lower copayments, copayments, and deductibles. 


How does the Marketplace decide what my cost sharing is? 
You qualify to enroll in a plan with lower copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles based on: 

 · Whether you are eligible for a tax credit 

 · The number of people in your household (the taxpayer and dependents listed on your federal 

income tax return) 

 · The income amount that you expect to put on your federal income tax return for 2015 

 · Whether you are American Indian or Alaska Native and a member of a federally-recognized tribe

Medicaid is health coverage for people with limited income or special health care needs. Medicaid covers 
services such as doctor visits, laboratory tests and hospital care. Medicaid also covers additional services for 
children up to a certain age. 


Do you have past medical bills? 
Medicaid may pay medical bills from the past three months. If you want to see if Medicaid will pay recent 
medical bills, contact the Medicaid at the number included above in this notice. You may then need to 
send the Medicaid copies of your unpaid medical bills from the last three months. 
How long can I keep my Medicaid health coverage? 
You must renew your Medicaid health coverage every year. Watch for a letter in the mail telling you if you 
need to send Medicaid more information at renewal time. 


What if information from my application changes during the year? 
Over the next year, you must report any changes that might affect whether you qualify for Medicaid, like if 
you move, your income changes, or the size of your family changes (for example, if you marry, divorce, 
become pregnant, or have a child.) To report changes, call the Medicaid agency in your state. 


Does Medicaid cover special health care needs? 
Yes. A person may qualify to get coverage for more health services and pay less for care if he or she has special 
health care needs, such as: 


 · Has a medical, mental health or substance abuse condition that limits the ability to work or go to 

school 

 · Needs help with daily activities, such as bathing or dressing 

 · Regularly gets medical care, personal care, or health services at home, an adult day center, or another 

community setting 

 · Lives in a long term care facility, group home, or nursing home 

 · Is blind 

 · Is terminally ill 

 

If a person has special health care needs, and wants to see if he or she qualifies, let us know. Call the state 
Medicaid agency or log into your Marketplace account at 

HealthCare.gov/marketplace. If the person qualified 
for other health coverage, he or she can keep it while the Medicaid agency decides if he or she qualifies for 
Medicaid.
